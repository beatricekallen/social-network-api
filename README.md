# Social Network API

This is a back-end API project for a social media site. Users can be added, edited, and deleted. Users also have the ability to post "thoughts" and become friends with other users on the site. Users can also post reactions to thoughts. Thoughts can be edited and deleted, and reactions can be deleted as well.

This project uses MongoDB, Mongoose, Node, and Express. Routes were tested using Insomnia.
